These are very basic Python files and were made for educational purposes and fun.
There is a function for playing sound/music and playing sound effects that might come in handy, I would assume you wouldn't need the entire Pygame library for it to work, just the modules that are imported at the beginning of the code.

If you want to do a pull request, I will look at it but it will be on my own time unfortunately.
